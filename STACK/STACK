STACK

1) Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

2)Stack follows LIFO order in which the element entered last in the stack  will be deleted or pushed out first.

3)The two main operation of stack are:
   i)push() : to insert an element in the stack
  ii)pop() : to delete an element from the stack

4)PUSH_STACK(STACK,TOP,MAX,ITEM)

Algorithm to push an item into stack.
            
    1) IF TOP = MAX   then
    Print “Stack is full”;
    Exit;
    2) Otherwise
    TOP: = TOP + 1;        /*increment TOP*/
    STACK (TOP):= ITEM;
    3) End of IF
    4) Exit
 

5 )POP_STACK(STACK,TOP,ITEM)

    Algorithm to pop an element from stack.

    1) IF TOP = 0 then
        Print “Stack is empty”;
        Exit;
    2) Otherwise
        ITEM: =STACK (TOP);
        TOP:=TOP – 1;
    3) End of IF
    4) Exit
